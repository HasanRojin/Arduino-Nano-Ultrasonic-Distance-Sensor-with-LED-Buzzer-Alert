 **Project Title:**  
*Ultrasonic Distance-Based LED Indicator Using Arduino Nano*  

---

### **Project Overview:**  
This project uses an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure distance and turns on an **LED** when an object is detected within a certain range. It’s a great way to learn about ultrasonic sensors and how they work with an Arduino Nano.

### **Components Required:**  
- **Arduino Nano**  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**  
- **1x LED (any color)**  
- **1x 220Ω Resistor**  
- **Jumper Wires**  
- **Breadboard (optional)**

### **How It Works:**  
1. The **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** sends out ultrasonic pulses and calculates the distance based on the time taken for the echo to return.  
2. The **Arduino Nano** reads this data and determines if the measured distance is below a threshold (e.g., 10 cm).  
3. If an object is detected within the set range, the **LED turns on**. Otherwise, it remains off.

### **Circuit Connections:**  
#### **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to Arduino Nano:**  
- **VCC** → 5V  
- **GND** → GND  
- **TRIG** → D2  
- **ECHO** → D3  

#### **LED to Arduino Nano:**  
- **Anode (long leg)** → D5 (through a 220Ω resistor)  
- **Cathode (short leg)** → GND  



### **Project Applications:**  
- Automatic obstacle detection.  
- Smart parking assist system.  
- Proximity-based warning systems.

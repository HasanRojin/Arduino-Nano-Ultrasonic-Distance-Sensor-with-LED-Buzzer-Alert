 **Project Title:**  
*Arduino Nano Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with LED & Buzzer Alert*  

---

### **Overview:**  
This project uses an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** with an **Arduino Nano** to measure distance. When an object comes too close, the **LED** lights up, and the **buzzer** sounds an alert.

### **Components Needed:**  
- **Arduino Nano**  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**  
- **LED (any color)**  
- **Buzzer**  
- **220Î© Resistor** (for LED)  
- **Jumper Wires**  
- **Breadboard (optional)**  

---

### **How It Works:**  
1. The **HC-SR04** emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for them to bounce back.  
2. The **Arduino Nano** calculates the distance using the speed of sound.  
3. If an object is detected within a **certain range**, the **LED turns on** and the **buzzer beeps**.  
4. If the object moves away, the LED turns off, and the buzzer stops.

### **Wiring Instructions:**  
| Component         | Arduino Nano Pin |
|------------------|----------------|
| **HC-SR04 TRIG** | D2 |
| **HC-SR04 ECHO** | D3 |
| **LED + Resistor** | D5 |
| **Buzzer** | D6 |
| **GND (HC-SR04, LED, Buzzer)** | GND |
| **VCC (HC-SR04, LED, Buzzer)** | 5V |

### **How to Use:**  
1. **Upload the code** to your **Arduino Nano** using the **Arduino IDE**.  
2. **Connect the circuit** as per the wiring diagram.  
3. **Power the Arduino Nano** and test by placing an object in front of the sensor.  
4. If the object is closer than **10 cm**, the **LED and buzzer** will activate.
